  A GitHub Action for compiling Typst files to PDF's using the latest Typst release.
</p>

## ✨ Features

## 📥 Inputs

## 🤸 Usage

To use this acton, create a workflow file (e.g. `.github/workflows/typst-compile.yml`) in your GitHub repository. 

Here's a basic example: 

```yaml

```

Here's a more complex example which does the following:
- Compiles the Typst files into PDF's
- Uploads artifacts of the PDF's
- If the action is run on a tag, creates a release with the PDF files

```yaml

```

## 🙌 Contributing
Contributions to the Typst Compiler GitHub Action are welcome! It is far from perfect, I threw  this together quickly to solve a personal problem. Please feel free to open a PR or issue with any changes!
